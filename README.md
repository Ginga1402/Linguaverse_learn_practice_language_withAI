The following technologies and libraries were used in the development of this application:

[Python](https://www.python.org/): Programming language used for the implementation.

[Langchain](https://www.langchain.com/): LangChain is a framework designed to simplify the creation of applications using large language models.

[Ollama](https://ollama.com/): It provides a simple API for creating, running, and managing models, as well as a library of pre-built models that can be easily used in a
variety of applications

Model Used: [Llama-3.2](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct) collection of multilingual large language models (LLMs) is a collection of pretrained and instruction-tuned generative models in 1B and 3B sizes (text in/text out). The Llama 3.2 instruction-tuned text only models are optimized for multilingual dialogue use cases, including agentic retrieval and summarization tasks.

[Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) is a general-purpose speech recognition model. It is trained on a large dataset of diverse audio and is also a multitasking model that can perform multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, and language identification.

[Gtts](https://pypi.org/project/gTTS/) gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech), a Python library and CLI tool to interface with Google Translate's text-to-speech API. Write spoken mp3 data to a file, a file-like object (bytestring) for further audio manipulation, or stdout.

[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) Streamlit lets you transform Python scripts into interactive web apps in minutes, instead of weeks. Build dashboards, generate reports, or create chat apps.
